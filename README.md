# CO-2-mining

Climat change is a coplikated topick but we know that the main issu is that we creating more and more $CO_2$ so we need to destroy a lot of $CO_2$ order to stop climatchange and some companes like Mamut in Iceland is building a $CO_2$ destoryer but the issue here is this is cost a lot of money (10-20 million $) and its not making money, so we need to motivate peoples to build more $CO_2$ destroyers but how?

What if they get reworded affter they destroyed a cupple tones of $CO_2$?
